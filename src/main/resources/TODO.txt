Villagers poi's will produce items,
    The poi's will have a map of the villager profession, and the items it can produce
    Or the villager contains a list of items it can produce, but the poi determines if it can accept the villager to produce items.

    But the downside of this is redudant code, like a tool smith and weapon smith, and armor smith all have similar items,
    need similar materials, so all might need to produce those similar materials in order to produce their final product
